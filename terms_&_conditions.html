                information relating to their areas of specialization, experience, availability, and any other important

                2.2. Fitness Experts are solely responsible for setting their Fitness Services, rates and availability.

                <br><br>

            <h4>3. CLIENT ACCEPTANCE AND DELIVERY OF FITNESS SERVICES
            </h4>
            <p>
                <br>
                3.1. Fitness Experts will review the application/booking submitted by clients through platform. The
                "Acceptance" of a Client occurs when you: (a) Accept to consider the application of a Client submitted

                disseminate, publish or disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party to any third party
                except for (a) Users who need to know of such information to use the Platform and (b) those with written
                authorization from the disclosing party for any purpose the information may serve.
                <br><br>
                5.4. Parties agree that all Confidential Information shall be treated with the same degree of care as it
                accords to its own Confidential Information, and that each Party has measures in place to keep its own
                Confidential Information private and protected against breach.
                <br><br>

                circumstances.
                <br><br>

                11.5. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales
                without regard to its conflict of law rules. If a Fitness Expert accesses the Platform from outside of
                said jurisdictions, they do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of
                that jurisdiction. The relationship of the Parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and
                these Terms will not be construed to imply that any Party is the agent, employee, or joint venture of
                the other. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, these Terms will
                continue in full force and effect without said provision and will be interpreted to reflect the original
                intent of the parties.

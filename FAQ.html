                            note that the amount you will be paying for is not just for the service offered by the
                            expert itself, but also their availability, experience and expertise. If you are paying for
                            a higher rate, then you should expect to get more services from your chosen expert.

                            The answer to this depends on the expert you employed as well as the services they provide.

                                <li>Actionable workout plan or training program, especially if you are undergoing
                                    personal training. A diet or nutrition plan may also be provided by a nutritionist
                                    or dietician.
                                </li>

                            That depends on the availability of the fitness expert. On average, response time takes
                            between 1-3 working days. However, there are also cases when bookings are unanswered. When
                            that happens, we will notify you about the status of your booking and offer recommendations
                            of fitness experts with similar services you are looking for.

                            For instance, if you have booked a personal trainer for strength training, your trainer may
                            check in on you for a couple of hours, 2 to 3 days a week for a full-body session (beginner

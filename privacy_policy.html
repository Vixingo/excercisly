            <h4>The Legal Basis for Processing your Personal Information
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Under GDPR, the main grounds that we rely upon to process personal information of clients and clients
                are the following:

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>(a) Necessary for entering into, or performing a contract - to perform obligations that we undertake in
                providing a service to you, or in order to take steps at your request to enter into a contract with us,
                it will be necessary for us to process your personal data;</p>
            <p>(b) Necessary for compliance with a legal obligation - we are subject to certain legal requirements which
                may require us to process your personal data. We may also be obliged by law to disclose your personal
                data to a regulatory body or law enforcement agency.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h4>How we share your Personal Information
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p>In certain circumstances, we will share your personal information with other parties. Details of those
                parties are set out below along with the reasons for sharing it.
                <br>
                Where you are registered as a client in our database, we will share your personal information with your
                chosen fitness expert/s so they can effectively deliver their services to you.
                <br>We will also share your personal information as above for any or all the following purposes:
                <ul>
                    <li>professional advisors;
                    </li>
                    <li>data analytics providers;
                    </li>
                    <li>IT consultants carrying out testing and development work on our business technology systems;
                    </li>
                    <li>research and mailing houses; and/or
                    </li>
                    <li>function coordinators.
                         
                    </li>
                </ul>


            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We require minimum standards of confidentiality and data protection from such third parties. To the
                extent that any personal information is provided to third parties outside the EEA, or who will access
                the information from outside the EEA, we will ensure that approved safeguards are in place, such as the
                approved Model Clauses or the EU/US Privacy Shield.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Regulatory and Law Enforcement Agencies
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p>As noted above, if we receive a request from a regulatory body or law enforcement agency, and if
                permitted under GDPR and other laws, we may disclose certain personal information to such bodies or
                agencies.



            </p>

            <h4> New business owners</h4>
            <br>

                personal information with the new owners of the business or company and their advisors. If this happens,
                you will be sent notice of such event.
            </p><br>
            <br>
            <h4>How long we will hold your information
                 
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p>The length of time we will hold or store your personal information for will depend on the services we
                perform for you and for how long you require these. As we often support clients in connect them with
                fitness experts who can assist them in their fitness journey and achievement of their fitness goals, the
                purpose for which we retain a client’s data is often an ongoing purpose.
                <br> <br>
                We conduct regular data-cleansing and updating exercises with our clients to ensure that (a) the data
                that we hold is accurate and (b) we are not holding data for too long.

                it, we will provide you with our reasons for doing so.
            </p>
